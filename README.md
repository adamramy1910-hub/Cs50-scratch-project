# CS50 Scratch Project

This is my final project for CS50's Scratch assignment.

## ðŸŽ® Project Description
The project is a Scratch program where you can build and run commands to control a character (named *Tera*).  
You can:
- Add commands (move, glide, ghost effect, sound, jump, etc.)
- Run the sequence of commands
- Reset the character
- Use the *Info* button to see available commands

The goal is to provide a simple "visual programming" environment inside Scratch itself.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Download the file *project.sb3* from this repository.
2. Go to [Scratch Online Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/).
3. From the top menu, click *File â†’ Load from your computer*.
4. Select *my project (X).sb3*.
5. Press the green flag inside Scratch to start.
